# Harder Water Exploration

#### What is this mod?

Harder Water Exploration is a mod that aims to make everything regarding spending time underwater harder. Right now, it's ridiciously easy.
- There are pretty much no dangers at all underwater besides drowned, and they are slow.
- The only proper danger is if you willingly go to a ocean monument.
- There are pretty much no rewards for exploring in lakes, oceans and rivers.

This mod aims to change that by adding new content and rebelancing some mechanics:

### Items

##### Bamboo pipe
Can be created by combining string, bamboo and flint. When worn in your main hand, it works as a less capable but cheaper bow and arrow, but they shoot wheat seeds (giving seeds, a extremly common plant material, some additional usage, and also gives players a very early game ranged option). Seeds have a theoretical max range of 80% less than the bow and arrow, and are also overall 20% slower. Each seed item can be turned into 2 seed ammo. Each seed deals half a heart of damage.
Finally! Wearing the Bamboo pipe in the headgear slot or the off-hand slot (giving you options on if you want to swim with a shield or have a helmet with enchantments) extends the amount of blocks you can dive under the water surface by 3 blocks (4 blocks if you have fullfilled the "Master Of The Waves" achivement). 
This makes this item infinitly usefull to carry with you even into late game.

##### Sail
This allows you to attach a sail to your boat, increasing it's travel speed on water by 10%. During rain it's 15%. During thunderstorms, it's detrimental to have a sail out, so keep it off during those. Cannot have mending but can be repaired with 3 leather. Crafted with 2 sticks, 1 iron, 3 leather and 2 string.

##### Super Sail
A rare reward from the [Megalodon](#megalodon), a incredibly tough boss designed to make you shit your pants while sailing during a thunderstorm and show some respect for the sea.
The Super Sail gives you a massive 25% speed boost to boats on water, During rain it's 30%! However like the normal sail, during thunderstorms it's detrimental to have it out. 
It cannot be crafted and cannot be repaired (one can toggle to make it repairable however, in which case phantom membranes are required, 3 of them).

### Mechanical/Balance changes and/or additions

### Mobs rebalanced/added

##### Sharks
##### Megalodon

The megalodon is a boss type monster that has a 0,05% chance of spawning between 2000 to 8000 blocks to anyone player that is close to a ocean biome. It tries to make a spawn every 2 minutes during thunderstorms. If a Megalodon did not spawn that day, the chance increases by 0,01% up to a max of 1%. On a successfull spawn this resets.
There's also a 0,001% chance of a Megalodon spawning while fishing with anything less than Luck of the Sea 1 enchantment in the ocean.
Finally, the Megalodon can be taunted to appear by fishing in a ocean with a glowing worm.

It's basically a gigantic fucking shark, and I woulnd't fuck with him if I were you.
It's HP scales to the number of players it can find within a 4k block radius upon it's spawn. If it get's over 2200 HP on spawn, it will add a additionall roll on it's table upon death.If it get's over 4400 HP, it will add an additional 40 bottles of enchanting to it's drop, 2 extra megalodon tooths will drop, and
