# Harder Water Exploration

#### What is this mod?

Harder Water Exploration is a mod that aims to make everything regarding spending time underwater harder. Right now, it's ridiciously easy.
- There are pretty much no dangers at all underwater besides drowned, and they are slow.
- The only proper danger is if you willingly go to a ocean monument.
- There are pretty much no rewards for exploring in lakes, oceans and rivers.

This mod aims to change that by adding new content and rebelancing some mechanics:

##### Items

- Bamboo pipe: Can be created by combining string, bamboo and flint. When worn in your main hand, it works as a less capable but cheaper bow and arrow, but they shoot wheat seeds (giving seeds, a extremly common plant material, some additional usage, and also gives players a very early game ranged option). Seeds have a theoretical max range of 80% less than the bow and arrow, and are also overall 20% slower. Each seed item can be turned into 2 seed ammo. Each seed deals half a heart of damage.
Finally! Wearing the Bamboo pipe in the headgear slot or the off-hand slot (giving you options on if you want to swim with a shield or have a helmet with enchantments) extends the amount of blocks you can dive under the water surface by 3 blocks ()
