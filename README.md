# Harder Water Exploration

#### What is this mod?

Harder Water Exploration is a mod that aims to make everything regarding spending time underwater harder. Right now, it's ridiciously easy.
- There are pretty much no dangers at all underwater besides drowned, and they are slow.
- The only proper danger is if you willingly go to a ocean monument.
- There are pretty much no rewards for exploring in lakes, oceans and rivers.

This mod aims to change that by adding new content and rebelancing some mechanics:

### Items

##### Glue
Glue is a core component of many recipes for the Harder Water Exploration mod. To make Glue, place a cauldron above a fireplace, then add a bucket of water to the cauldron. Then toss in a cooked beef, 2 bonemeal and a leather piece or a bunny leather piece. After 10 seconds, bubbles will appear in the cauldron, right click it to recivie 1 glue. The number of glue you get is based on the number of ingredients you tossed in, but only 16 glue per cooking, for a stack of 64 glue for example, you need to toss in 64 cooked beef, 2 stacks of bonemeal and 64 leather. You can make at most 16 glue every 10 seconds.
##### Bamboo pipe
Can be created by cutting the bamboo in half with a grindstone, then you need to carve it with a flint (put flint and 2 bamboo halves onto the 2x2 crafting grid to get 2 carved bamboo halves). You need a total of 4 bamboo halves to make the bamboo pipe. Combine 4 bamboo halves with 2 string and 1 glue to get the Bamboo pipe.

When worn in your main hand, it works as a less capable but cheaper bow and arrow, but they shoot wheat seeds (giving seeds, a extremly common plant material, some additional usage, and also gives players a very early game ranged option). Seeds have a theoretical max range of 80% less than the bow and arrow, and are also overall 20% slower. Each seed item can be turned into 2 seed ammo. Each seed deals half a heart of damage.
Finally! Wearing the Bamboo pipe in the headgear slot or the off-hand slot (giving you options on if you want to swim with a shield or have a helmet with enchantments) extends the amount of blocks you can dive under the water surface by 3 blocks (4 blocks if you have fullfilled the "Master Of The Waves" achivement). 
This makes this item infinitly usefull to carry with you even into late game.

##### Flippers
A pair of flippers that increases Swimming speed by 23%, bringing you 8% above the default swim speed of minecraft. They are made with 4 leather, 2 glue and  2string.

##### Sail
This allows you to attach a sail to your boat, increasing it's travel speed on water by 10%. During rain it's 15%. During thunderstorms, it's detrimental to have a sail out, so keep it off during those. Cannot have enchantments but can be repaired with 3 leather. Has a complex crafting recipe, but the totals you need are 6 leather, 5 glue, 3 iron ingots, 3 sticks and 3 string. The Sail can have a "flag" attached which is basically a slot for a minecraft map. Just combine the Sail with a item frame.

##### Super Sail
A rare reward from the [Megalodon](#megalodon), a incredibly tough boss designed to make you shit your pants while sailing during a thunderstorm and show some respect for the sea.
The Super Sail gives you a massive 25% speed boost to boats on water, During rain it's 30%! However like the normal sail, during thunderstorms it's detrimental to have it out. 
It cannot be crafted and cannot be repaired (one can toggle to make it repairable however, in which case phantom membranes are required, 3 of them).

##### Chest Attachment
Adding this to a boat allows you to attach a chest to the boat, works kinda like the donkey chest works. Crafted with 1 chest, 2 string and 4 iron ingots.

##### Enderchest Attachment
Adding this to a boat allows you to attach a enderchest to the boat, works kinda like the donkey chest but has enderchest properties. Cannot be crafted.

##### Megalodon Tooth
Basically a trophy gained for killing the [Megalodon](#megalodon).

### Mechanical/Balance changes and/or additions
- Reduced the maxair of players by 150. Effectively cutting the amount of air meter in half from Minecrafts default.
- Reduced the speed of regaining air by 10%
- Increased the speed at which you loose air by 15%.
- Reduced the swim speed by 15%


### Mobs rebalanced/added

##### Sharks
Sharks are neutral mobs who can only survive in the ocean biome and it's deratives, all other bodies of water kills it (exception is sharks summoned by command or similar cheat).
They enter a bloodlust if you or another mob is closer than 30 blocks with less than full HP. Once the bloodlust has been activated, it lasts for 180 seconds and is refreshed if attacked. During it, sharks will attack anything that is not a dolphin or a megalodon.
It attacks by swimming towards you and taking a bite, then it tries to swim away so you can't retaliate as easily because it's bad at turning.
You can completely dodge a attack by blocking with a shield when it attacks, but it costs 1/4 of the durability on the shield.

##### Megalodon
The megalodon is a boss type monster that has a 0,05% chance of spawning between 2000 to 8000 blocks to anyone player that is close to a ocean biome. It tries to make a spawn every 2 minutes during thunderstorms. If a Megalodon did not spawn that day, the chance increases by 0,01% up to a max of 1%. On a successfull spawn this resets.
There's also a 0,001% chance of a Megalodon spawning while fishing with anything less than Luck of the Sea 1 enchantment in the ocean.
Finally, the Megalodon can be taunted to appear by fishing in a ocean with a glowing worm.

It's basically a gigantic fucking shark, and I woulnd't fuck with him if I were you.
it follows the basic Shark AI when attacking but is always in a permanent bloodlust, it also slaps it's tail sometimes, if you are near the tail or directly under it, you'll get the wind knocked out of you, disabling your ability to move for 5 seconds, removing 80% of your current oxygen and causing you to swim 10% slower for 10 seconds. Shield blocking works for the Megalodon too in order to completely dodge a attack. But a full durability shield can only take 2 attacks instead of the Sharks 4 attacks before breaking.

It's HP scales to the number of players it can find within a 4k block radius upon it's spawn. If it get's over 2200 HP on spawn, it will add a additionall roll on it's table upon death. If it get's over 4400 HP, it will add an additional 40 bottles of enchanting to it's drop, 2 extra [Megalodon tooths](#megalodon-tooth) will drop (for a total of 3).

If Above 10000 hp, it will drop 64 Emeral Blocks guaranteed.

The number of rolls on the table upon the death of the Megalodon is decided by the level of fortune that killed it.
1 roll = No Fortune enchantment, 2 rolls = Fortune Level 1, 3 rolls = Fortune Level 2.


Here's the loot table (below 2200 hp):

| Item | Chance | Amount | Comments |
| --------------- | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| Megalodon Tooth | 100% | 1 | No matter how many rolls, only a single tooth will drop, this always drops |
| Bottle of Enchanting | 100% | 40 | No matter how many rolls, a max of 40 Bottles will drop, this always drops |
| Totem of Undying | 15% | 1-3 | 33% chance of 1, 33% chance of 2, 33 % chance of 3 |
| Enchant: Channeling | 15% | 1-2 | 50/50 chance of either amount dropping |
| Enchant: Mending | 15% | 2-4 | 40% chance of 2, 40% chance of 3, 20% chance of 4 |
| Super Sail | 20% | 1-2 | 50/50 chance of either amount dropping |
| Skeleton head | 10% | 2 | Seems like sombody sailed a raft down into those jaws, but they never made it out... |
| Golden Chest | 10% | 1 | Contains anywhere between 1 emerald, 1 iron and 1 diamond to 20 of each and has it's own loot table |
| EnderChest Attachment | 14% | 2-4 | 50% chance of 2, 24% chance of 3, 1 % chance of 4.  |
| Dragon Boat | 1% | 1 | Ultra rare boat that has a 20% speedboost, with a sail equipped it also has a jump function (the dragon boats speedbost stack with other sailing bonuses) |
